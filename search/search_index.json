These security configurations can shield and protect those servers by implementing the desired security measures depending on the server profile. Controls are sourced from the CIS Benchmarks , and we also need to obtain system information about each of the deployed servers to ensure proper deployment. To achieve that, Egida is built using a microservices-based architecture composed of the following three modules: egida : This is the main module, in charge of providing the communication interfaces with the user, as well as the process of the specific domain language called Aspida. Using this module, the user can define the different profiles to work with and the actions to be performed. egida-roles : This module contains the definition of the Ansible roles that contains the actions corresponding to the security controls that are defined for each profile that a machine may have assigned. These actions can be either hardening operations (CIS Benchmarks) or setup actions to prepare that machine so it can be used correctly by Egida. egida-api : The functionality of this module is to provide information of each machine to be used by Egida. This information can be varied: the services that are currently running, the operating system version or the score obtained with the Lynis tool\u2026 any kind of information that we determine it is interesting to better deploy any security control. Installation Prerequisites Egida v1.0.0 requires the following software to be installed on the master node: Currently, Egida v1.0.0 needs an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS OS. Ansible >2.8 : Install Ansible sudo apt update sudo apt install software-properties-common sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible sudo apt install ansible Python 3.x : Install Python 3 sudo apt update sudo apt install software-properties-common sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa sudo apt install python3.7 sudo apt install python3-pip At this point, Python 3.7 is installed on your Ubuntu system and ready to be used. You can verify it by typing python3.7 --version unzip : Install Unzip sudo apt install unzip Download and install In order to install the Egida core you have to follow the instructions below. wget https://github.com/antonioalfa22/egida/releases/download/1.0.3/install.sh sudo chmod +x install.sh sudo ./install.sh Getting Started Getting Started Environment SetUp Environment SetUp Add Host Add Host Variables Variables Hardening Hardening All CIS Benchmarks All CIS Points CIS Points CIS Sections CIS Sections CIS Controls CIS Controls Getting Info Getting Info Lynis Score Lynis Score Machine Info Machine Info License Distributed under the Apache 2.0 License.
